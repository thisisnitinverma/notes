===========================================
There are a few aesthetic no-no’s that top the list for what you want to watch out for when picking your domain. 
These mostly involve subtle changes that will make it difficult to remember or spell your domain name. 
For instance, having two consonants or vowels back-to-back can result in a lot of misspellings, as people might not remember to include both letters.
Another thing to watch out for is including too many trendy words. 
For example, you might think it’s cool to add a “z” to your domain name instead of an “s”, or use the lower-case “i” before your business name, reminiscent of Apple.
Changing common words into more trendy versions might seem like a smart move to make now. However, it might not make much sense a few years into the future. 
The last thing you want is to have to re-brand your site in a few years, because you didn’t have the foresight at the time.
Lastly, make sure not to include any hyphens if possible. 
A lot of times hyphens get left out when typing a URL in the address bar.
 When in doubt choose a name that has less stylistic elements. 
You want a domain that will stand the test of time.
